# Partial Correlation Calculator (PCC)

The Partial Correlation Calculator (PCC) is a web application for computing partial correlation coefficients. 
The PCC aims to serve researchers in laboratory settings, where popular analytic software does not support partial correlation coefficient computation.
The application offers support for user dataset upload, variable selection, adjustment of analysis parameters, and result exportation.
PCC is coded in R using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).

Partial correlation coefficients are computed to determine the magnitude of a relationship between two variables, adjusting for the effect of extraneous variables.
This technique is useful in contexts where statistical models are inappropriate, or for researchers in laboratory settings where low sample size data is common.

## Usage

The PCC hosted online at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's [Biostatistics Tools Page](https://www.med.unc.edu/cfar/resources/biostatistics-resources/). For a direct link, [click here](www.google.com).

The application is also available on the PCC [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mkdinwid/PCC/tree/main/R). 
To run the PCC locally, you must download both `server.r` and `app.r` and store them in the same directory. Running either file will launch the PCC.
